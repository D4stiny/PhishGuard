# PhishGuard
PhishGuard is a way for you to make sure you know what you're clicking on!

## Downloads
Download the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/phishguard/ngafnigajpgginnijhfcbeikpakecppl?utm_source=gmail).

## What is it?
This extension aims to prevent email phishing attacks by telling you where links really lead. The way it works if it detects a clickable link and the location it leads to is somewhere different from what is advertised, it will highlight it red, bold it, and when you hover over the link, it will tell you where it really leads!

Currently, the extension supports both gmail and outlook/hotmail. However, future support for other mail providers such as Yahoo is planned!
